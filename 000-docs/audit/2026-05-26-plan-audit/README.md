## Pre-existing internal review

Before opening the formal panel, a **cheap-first pre-flight review** (`internal-review-2026-05-27.md`) ran 4 agents (article-consistency, architect, code, fact-checker) against the v4 plan + Steps 1-3 output. Surfaced 6 P0 BLOCKERs which were folded into v4.1 in commit `22fc55e` (PR #77). 12 P1 findings are deferred to § 13 Step 5 remediation queue. The panel sees the v4.1 plan + the internal review report (NOT in brief pack — would bias seats toward predetermined conclusions per the article-consistency seat's own P2 finding).

## Output (will populate)

- `findings/<seat-name>-findings.md` — 7 individual files, one per seat
- `synthesis.md` — acting-CTO synthesis (convergent vs divergent findings)
- `remediation-map.md` — finding-ID → plan-section / bead-ID
- `STATUS.md` — `OPEN` → `RATIFIED` (or `RATIFIED-WITH-DELTAS` after Step 5)

## Severity rubric (per § 12)

| Level | Action |
|---|---|
| P0 BLOCKER | Plan amendment required before any Phase begins; cannot ratify |
| P1 CRITICAL | Plan amendment required before the affected Phase begins |
| P2 MAJOR | New bead filed; addressed in plan v5 |
| P3 MINOR | Tracked in AAR backlog |
| NIT | Inline edit during synthesis |

## Hard gate

Per plan § 13 Step 7: **NO `bd claim` against any Skill Refiner bead until this audit's `STATUS.md` reads `RATIFIED`.**
